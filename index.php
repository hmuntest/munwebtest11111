          <div class="section-wide">
            <h5 class="spirit">Dear Delegates and Faculty Advisors,</h5>
            <p>It is my great pleasure to invite you to the sixty-first session of Harvard Model United Nations. HMUN 2014 will be held from Thursday, January 30, to Sunday, February 2, 2014 at the Sheraton Boston Hotel. After a hugely successful sixtieth session, I could not be more excited to embark on this year of preparation for another simulation of distinguished United Nations bodies, diverse international organizations, and dynamic non-state actors. Our staff of dedicated Harvard students is already beginning conference preparations, and we look forward to welcoming you to Boston next January!</p>
            <p>We at HMUN are deeply committed to sharing the experience of learning about and practicing international relations. HMUN 2014 will be accessible to as many students from all over the world as possible. To this end, we will offer more financial aid to delegations in need than ever before. Furthermore, we are working hard to increase the use of technology and multimedia in all of our committees in order to increase both the realism and excitement of our simulation. Finally, we look forward to proudly showcasing our beautiful campus with activities and tours over the course of the weekend.</p>
            <p>Registration opens on May 1, 2013 and applications completed by May 29will receive priority consideration for acceptance and country assignments. This year, HMUN will also have a second Priority Registration Deadline of September 1. All applications received between May 30 and September 1 will be considered for acceptance on a rolling basis. Country assignments will be issued in early September for schools applying by the second Priority Registration Deadline. Applications received after September 1 will be considered on a rolling basis.</p>
            <p>Whether you have attended HMUN for years or will be participating for the first time, I strongly encourage you to submit your application by the first Priority Registration Deadline on May 29. Until then, please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions, comments, or concerns. HMUN is an exciting educational opportunity, and I sincerely hope that you will choose to take part in it. If you have any questions before then, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
            <p>Sincerely,</p>
