The matrix also lists if committees are single or double delegation (marked by either "1" - single delegate, or "2" - double delegate). Please refer to this matrix as your delegation submits your country preferences through your MyMUN account, by referring to the projected number of committee spots for each country and the number of delegates your delegation has. The Matrix is subject to change.</p>
                <p>The WorldMUN team will assign delegations country/committee assignments as soon as your delegation has made full payment. We remind all delegations that the Priority Full Payment Deadline is 15 December 2013, and the Regular Full Payment Deadline is 15 January 2014.</p>
                <p>Please note, selecting preferences does not guarantee your delegation a spot on a specific country; the WorldMUN team retains the right to make country assignments, and all assignments made by the WorldMUN team will be final.</p>
                <p>Delegation preferences for countries and committees, including Specialized Agencies, are due by <b>11:59pm EST 15 November 2013</b>.</p>

            <div class="trips">
              <p>Thanks to its central position in Europe, Brussels is an ideal location to start a trip across the old continent, or simply to have a short stay of a few days in one of the many neighboring capitals.</p>
              <p>This year, the Organizing Committee has prepared numerous pre- and post-conference trips that you can see by clicking on the links below.</p>
              <p>Although these trips can be booked exactly as they are proposed in the brochures, we wanted to make sure that you could create your very own trip across Europe. Therefore, not only can you change the dates or the length of the stay in a city, but you can also combine several cities among those which are proposed, or add the ones you would like to visit to your trip.</p>
              <p>In order to book your pre- or post-conference trips and/or create your own journey, please contact our partner travel agency, Connections Group Travel, at <a class="bold-link" href="mailto:groups@connections.be">groups@connections.be</a>. Don’t forget to mention you’re contacting about group travel for WorldMUN 2014. Booking with Connections will allow you the greatest flexibility and peace of mind as you prepare for WorldMUN.</p>
